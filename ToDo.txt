Snippet from forum to have more than one watch talk to a single accesspoint:

    yes, actually i found an easy solution
    in main_ed_bm.c file in chronos sports watch software,
    simpliciti_data[0]=0x01; // for chronos 1
    same thing for chronos2 as
    simpliciti_data[0]=0x02;
    and so on for the rest of two.
    then I simply change the code for the access point in order to support more than 1 end device, you may check a nice example from rf2500 kit's software.
